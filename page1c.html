                In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: <span class="opacity">no one has yet to</span> begin <span class="opacity">a life who will not</span> end <span class="opacity">it.</span>

                In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.

                Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said <span class="hover-text">that no poem is ever</span> ended, <span class="hover-text">that every poem is merely</span> abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.

                <br>
                <br>
                Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it: <span class="hover-text">the</span> opening <span class="hover-text">line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.</span></p>
