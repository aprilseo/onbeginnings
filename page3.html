                Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: <span class="hover-text">if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a </span>dead-end<span class="hover-text"> alley, at the top of a cliff you havenâ€™t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.</span>

                I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.
