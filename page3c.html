                I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.

                 Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: <span class="hover-text">Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence</span> begins <span class="hover-text">with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and</span> ends <span class="hover-text">with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence</span> end.
